## Steps Taken

### Data Cleaning:
- Checked for missing data using:
  ```excel
  =IF(COUNTA(A2:Q4522)=ROWS(A2:Q4522)*COLUMNS(A2:Q4522),"No Missing Data","Missing Data Found")
- Formatted monetary values according to accounting standards for better readability.
- Flagged negative balances with **dark orange fill** to indicate potential financial distress.
- Highlighted zero balances in **red** to suggest clients requiring re-engagement.
- Excluded rows with **undefined education levels** to maintain data consistency.

### Data Transformation
- Converted call duration from **seconds to minutes** and rounded to **1 decimal place**.
- Grouped call duration and account balances using the `IFS()` formula for better segmentation.
- Categorized the day of the month into:
  - **Beginning** (1â€“10)
  - **Middle** (11â€“20)
  - **End** (21â€“31)  
  This supported strategic timing analysis for outreach.


## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: Efficient data preprocessing.
- **Pivot Charts**: Interactive visualizations and insights.
- **Custom Icons & Design Elements**: Enhanced readability and visual appeal.
